# Root 3 Lite

The Root 3 Lite is base from the R3 standard version but one a smaller desktop size footprint. R3 Lite uses 20mm box section instead of the 25mm box sections used on the Root 3 and Root 2 machines. Its is aim toward the light works loads than the its bigger brother but dont let the small size fool you â€“ this machine is very capable.

Key design decisions:  
1- use only NEMA 17 stepper motors â€“ I wanted to try and keep this machine fairly standard to easy new comers to the CNC arena.  
2- Use standard 3d Printer parts  
3- lighter weight Carriages â€“ I would like to try and turn this into a 3D printer in the future.
